# Chatbot Project with Custom Knowledge Base

## Overview
This chatbot is designed to provide accurate, context-aware answers by leveraging your custom database. You can upload files or add links directly through the user interface to build a personalized knowledge base. The chatbot uses advanced AI techniques to process and retrieve information, ensuring reliable and precise responses tailored to your needs.

## Key Features
- **Custom Knowledge Base**: Upload files (PDF, Word documents) or add web links to create your database.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.
- **Accurate Responses**: Answers questions using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.
- **Advanced NLP**: Powered by Large Language Models (Google Gemini or OpenAI).
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Processes and analyzes your document and other structured data with Pandas.
- **Web Scraping**: Dynamically gathers content from the web using Beautiful Soup.

## Tech Stack
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Ensures accurate and context-aware responses.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Powered by **Google Gemini** or **OpenAI** models for natural language understanding.
- **Data Processing**: Efficient handling of data using **Pandas** and custom scripts.
- **Streamlit**: Provides an intuitive and interactive web interface.
- **Python**: Powers all application logic, data processing, and integrations.
- **Vector Database(Pinecone)**: Ensures fast and relevant information retrieval.
- **Web Scraping**: Uses **Beautiful Soup** to extract and structure data from online sources.
- **Document Parsing**: Supports PDF and Word documents for database creation.
